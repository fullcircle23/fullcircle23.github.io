# Gestalt Principles in UI and UX

“The whole is other than the sum of the parts.” — Kurt Koffka

### The Base Principles

* **EMERGENCE** — The whole is identified before the parts

* **REIFICATION** — Our mind fills in the gaps

* **MULTI-STABILITY** — The mind seeks to avoid uncertainty

* **INVARIANCE** — We’re good at recognizing similarities and differences

### 20 Gestalt Principles

“All else being equal, elements that are related by X tend to be grouped perceptually into higher-order units.” — Stephen Palmer

1. PROXIMITY (Emergence)

    “Objects that are closer together are perceived as more related than objects that are further apart.”
    We group closer-together elements, separating them from those farther apart.

2. SIMILARITY (Invariance)

    “Elements that share similar characteristics are perceived as more related than elements that don't share those characteristics.”

3. CONTINUATION

    “Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve.”
    We follow and “flow with” lines.

4. CLOSURE (Reification)

    “When seeing a complex arrangement of elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.”
    Preferring complete shapes, we automatically fill in gaps between elements to perceive a complete image; so, we see the whole first.

5. UNIFORM CONNECTEDNESS

    “Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.”
    We group elements linked by other elements.

6. FIGURE/GROUND (Multi-stability)

    “Elements are perceived as either figure (the element in focus) or ground (the background on which the figure rests).” 
    Disliking uncertainty, we look for solid, stable items. Unless an image is truly ambiguous, its foreground catches the eye first.

7. AREA

    “The smaller of two overlapping objects is seen as figure. The larger is seen as ground.”

8. CONVEXITY

    “Convex rather than concave patterns tend to be perceived as figures.”

9. PRÄGNANZ (GOOD FORM, LAW OF SIMPLICITY)

    “People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible.”
    We perceive complex or ambiguous images as simple ones.

10. GOOD FORM
    
    We differentiate elements that are similar in color, form, pattern, etc. from others—even when they overlap—and cluster them together.

11. MEANINGFULNESS (FAMILIARITY)

    We group elements if they form a meaningful or personally relevant image.

12. COMMON REGIONS (ENCLOSURE)

    “Elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region.”
    We group elements that are in the same closed region.

13. COMMON FATE

    “Elements that move in the same direction are perceived as more related than elements that are stationary or that move in different directions.”
    We group elements that move in the same direction.
    _Related principle: Synchrony_

14. SYNCHRONY

    We group static visual elements that appear at the same time.

15. SYMMETRY AND ORDER

    “People tend to perceive objects as symmetrical shapes that form around their center.”
    We seek balance and order in designs, struggling to do so if they aren’t readily apparent.

16. FOCAL POINTS

    “Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer’s attention.”

17. PARALLELISM

    “Elements that are parallel to each other are seen as more related than elements not parallel to each other.”

18. REGULARITY

    Sorting items, we tend to group some into larger shapes, and connect any elements that form a pattern.

19. SIMPLICITY

    Elements are always perceived in the most easiest way possible. 

20. PAST EXPERIENCES

    “Elements tend to be perceived according to an observer's past experience.”
    This is the weakest principle. It is unique to the individual, and common experiences tend to be cultural.
