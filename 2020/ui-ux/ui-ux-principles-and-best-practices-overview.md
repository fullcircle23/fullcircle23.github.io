There are many sources of UI/UX and Usability principles ranging from the general or "broad rules of thumb" to specific application features.

The most-used heuristics are probably [Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

As Nielsen's heuristics are ["broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), 
it seemed a good exercise to see how the larger number of principles by the other providers could _**all**_ be contained within only 10 heuristics.

Thus, I set to _map_ and _link_ the appropriate UI/UX principles from the following sources

* [Tognazzini's 19 First Principles of Interaction Design](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/first-principles-of-interaction-design)
* [Weinschenk and Barker 20 classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation#Weinschenk_and_Barker_classification) 
* [Whitney Hess's 20 Guiding Principles for UX Designers](https://uxmag.com/articles/guiding-principles-for-ux-designers) 
* [Will Grant's 101 UX Principles book published by Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/101-ux-principles)

to each heuristic in [Nielsen's list](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

Since there are 10 heuristics in Nielsen's list, there will be 10 sets of linked principles. 
The format for each set will thus be as follows:

- Nielsen's heuristic
  - Tognazzini's principle(s)
  - Weinschenk's and Barker's principle(s)
  - Hess's principle(s)
  - Grant's principle(s)
  - _Notes_

The _Notes_ placeholder in the above layout is for documenting exceptions, if any, as well as other concepts or patterns that help elucidate the principles.

I have also found Toni Granollers's paper [_Usability Evaluation with Heuristics, Beyond Nielsen’s List_](https://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=achi_2018_4_10_20055) 
which merged Nielsen’s and Tognazzini’s lists into 15 general principles to be quite useful in this endeavour.

I hope that linking together the UI/UX principles by multiple providers bestows a holistic understanding of each and every principle
thus making them easier to be applied in UI/UX design or used in Usability Inspection and Analysis.

For the results of linking together the principles from the five different sources, 
please go to [UI/UX Principles and Best Practices](https://github.com/fullcircle23/fullcircle23.github.io/blob/master/2020/ui-ux/ui-ux-principles-and-best-practices.md).
