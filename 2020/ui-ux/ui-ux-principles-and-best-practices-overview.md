There are many sources of UI/UX and Usability principles ranging from the general or "broad rules of thumb" to specific application features.

The most-used heuristics are probably [Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

As Nielsen's heuristics are "broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines", it made sense to see how they
would contain the principles by other providers.

This UI/UX guide "maps" and "links" appropriate UI/UX principles from the following sources 
* [Tognazzini's 19 First Principles of Interaction Design](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/first-principles-of-interaction-design)
* [Weinschenk and Barker 20 classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation#Weinschenk_and_Barker_classification) 
* [Whitney Hess's 20 Guiding Principles for UX Designers](https://uxmag.com/articles/guiding-principles-for-ux-designers) 
* [Will Grant's 101 UX Principles book published by Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/101-ux-principles)

to [Nielsen's list](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) 
resulting in the following set of associated principles and best practices for each of Nielsen's heuristic:

- Nielsen's heuristic
  - Tognazzini's principle(s)
  - Weinschenk's and Barker's principle(s)
  - Hess's principle(s)
  - Grant's principle(s)
  - Notes

I hope that linking together the UI/UX principles by multiple providers bestows a holistic understanding of each and every principle
thereby making them easier to be applied in UI/UX design and used in Usability Inspection and Analysis.

The "Notes" item in the above layout is to document exceptions, if any, as well as other concepts or patterns that help elucidate the principles.

I have also found Toni Granollers's work in a paper titled ["Usability Evaluation with Heuristics, Beyond Nielsen’s List"](https://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=achi_2018_4_10_20055) 
which merged Nielsen’s and Tognazzini’s lists into 15 general principles to be quite useful in this endeavour.

Here is my final list with 10 general principles:
