# Design Review

A design review is a usability-inspection method in which (usually) one reviewer examines a design to identify usability problems.

Common types:
- [Heuristic evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/)
- [Standalone design critique](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-critiques/)
- [Expert Reviews](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-expert-reviews/)

## Expert Reviews

### Components

#### List of usability strengths

Confirm the good design elements to ensure they are not marred in the redesign process.

#### List of usability problems

Clearly map the principle violated to where they occur.

#### Severity ratings for each usability problem

Factors
* The frequency with which the problem occurs: Is it common or rare?
* The impact of the problem if it occurs: Will it be easy or difficult for the users to overcome?
* The persistence of the problem: Is it a one-time problem that users can overcome once they know about it or will users repeatedly be bothered by the problem?

Rating
* 0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
* 1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
* 2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
* 3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
* 4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released
