## #58. Show a Numeric Progress Indicator on the Progress Bar
-  Show a "percentage complete" numeric indicator on a progress bar, if there's time to read it
-  For long processes, consider showing time remaining
-  If you can't show an accurate estimate of time remaining, just revert to a percentage
