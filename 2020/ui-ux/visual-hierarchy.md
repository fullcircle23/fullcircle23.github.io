# Visual Hierarchy
Organizing content to follow natural eye movement patterns

In a hierarchy
- we organize items from the most to the least important
- we show relationships (where relationships exist) between content blocks

So hierarchies give us order that helps make sense of a design easily. We want to prioritize headers and menus according to how we know what our users want and what we want them to do. We process information visually, perceiving elements in the order in which the designer has emphasized them according to these visual characteristics:

* Size — Larger elements will dominate and catch eyes first.
* Color — Bright colors catch eyes ahead of muted, drab ones.
* Contrast — Stark differences between elements draw eyes to the brighter one.
* Alignment — Users expect to find certain elements in the same place.
* Repetition — A repeated quality (e.g.,colored parts of text) draws the user’s eye.
* Proximity — Putting related elements (e.g., header with associated text) close together means these are related.
* Whitespace — Including whitespace around elements singles them out as separate groups of information.
* Texture and Style — Using distinct textures/styles (e.g., chunky, military-style buttons) draws the eye while setting the theme.


## Visual Hierarchy Patterns

The Z Pattern — In designs without much text, our eye starts scanning from top left to top right, then diagonally down to bottom left, stopping at the bottom right.

The F Pattern — In designs with more text, we scan across the top, from left to right, then down the left, searching for clues to what we want to know. On finding one, we’ll scan across to the right.
